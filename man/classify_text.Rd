)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{The text to be classified}

\item{instructions}{Instructions to be included in the GPT-3 prompt (format them like you would format instructions to a human research assistant).}

\item{examples}{A dataframe of "few-shot" examples. Must include one column called 'text' with the example text(s) and another column called "label" with the correct label(s).}

\item{model}{Which model variant of GPT-3 to use. Defaults to 'text-davinci-003'}

\item{openai_api_key}{Your API key. By default, looks for a system environment variable called "OPENAI_API_KEY" (recommended option). Otherwise, it will prompt you to enter the API key as an argument.}
}
\value{
